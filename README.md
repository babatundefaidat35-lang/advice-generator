# 🎲 Advice Generator App

A sleek, responsive web application that provides random pieces of wisdom at the click of a button. This project was built as a solution to the [Frontend Mentor Advice Generator challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

## 🚀 Live Demo
You can view the live site here: [**Advice Generator Live**](https://babatundefaidat35-lang.github.io)

## ✨ Features
* **Random Advice Generation:** Fetches data from the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com).
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
* **Interactive UI:** Hover states for the dice button and smooth transitions.
* **Clean Code:** Structured with semantic HTML and modern CSS.

## 🛠️ Built With
* **HTML5** - Semantic markup for accessibility and structure.
* **CSS3** - Custom styling, Flexbox for centering, and responsive media queries.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Fetch API for asynchronous data retrieval and DOM manipulation.

## 📋 How to Use
1. Open the [Live Site](https://babatundefaidat35-lang.github.io).
2. Click the **Dice Icon** at the bottom of the card.
3. Wait for the new advice to load (the API has a small cooldown between requests).

## 🧠 What I Learned
During this project, I focused on:
* Handling asynchronous requests using `fetch` and `async/await`.
* Implementing a "mobile-first" design workflow.
* Styling custom components like the dice button with absolute positioning and hover effects.
